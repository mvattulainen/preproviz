Title: Tools for Visualization of Interdependent Data Quality Issues
Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: person("Markus", "Vattulainen", email = "markus.vattulainen@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Data quality issues such as missing values and outliers are often
    interdependent, which makes preprocessing both time-consuming and leads to
    suboptimal performance in knowledge discovery tasks. This package supports
    preprocessing decision making by visualizing interdependent data quality issues
    through means of feature construction. The user can define his own application
    domain specific constructed features that express the quality of a data point
    such as number of missing values in the point or use nine default features.
    The outcome can be explored with plot methods and the feature constructed data
    acquired with get methods.
