Title: Tools for Visualization of Interdependent Data Quality Issues for Faster
    and More Effective Preprocessing
Version: 0.7.0

Description: Data Quality issues such as missing values and outliers are often
    interdependent, which makes preprocessing both time-consuming and often leads
    to suboptimal performance in knowledge discovery tasks. Package 'preproviz'
    supports preprocessing decision making by visualizing interdependent data
    quality issues through means of feature construction. The user can define
    his own application domain specific constructed features or use nine default
    features such number of missing values of all variables, outlier score or
    classification certainty. The outcome can be explored with plotting methods or
    the feature constructed data acquired by get methods.
