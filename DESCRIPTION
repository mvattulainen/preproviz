Title: Tools for Visualization of Interdependent Data Quality Issues for Faster
    and More Effective Preprocessing
Version: 0.7.0
Authors@R: person("Markus", "Vattulainen", email = "markus.vattulainen@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Data quality issues such as missing values and outliers are
    often interdependent, which makes preprocessing both time-consuming and leads
    to suboptimal performance in knowledge discovery tasks. Package 'preproviz'
    supports preprocessing decision making by visualizing interdependent data
    quality issues through means of feature construction. The user can define his
    own application domain specific constructed features that express the quality
    of a data point such as number of missing values in the point or use nine
    default features. The outcome can be explored with plot methods and the feature
    constructed data acquired with get methods.
